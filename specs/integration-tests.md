# Integration Tests Specification

## Overview

This specification outlines the approach for implementing integration tests for the Prosemark application. Integration tests will verify that different components of the system work together correctly and that the application functions as expected in real-world scenarios.

## Goals

- Validate end-to-end workflows from CLI commands to storage and back
- Test file system interactions to ensure proper handling of files and directories
- Ensure the application behaves correctly under various conditions and edge cases
- Complement unit tests by testing component interactions

## Test Categories

### End-to-End Workflow Tests

These tests will simulate complete user workflows, executing CLI commands and verifying the results.

1. **Project Creation and Management Workflow**
   - Create a new project
   - List projects to verify creation
   - Delete a project
   - Verify project no longer exists

2. **Node Management Workflow**
   - Create a project
   - Add multiple nodes with different relationships
   - Move nodes within the structure
   - Remove nodes
   - Verify final structure matches expectations

3. **Content Editing Workflow**
   - Create a project with nodes
   - Edit node content using different methods (direct parameters and editor)
   - Verify content changes are persisted
   - Test concurrent edits to ensure data integrity

### File System Interaction Tests

These tests will focus on how the application interacts with the file system.

1. **File Structure Tests**
   - Verify project directory structure is created correctly
   - Ensure files are named and organized according to specifications
   - Test handling of special characters in filenames

2. **File Content Tests**
   - Verify Markdown files contain correct content and formatting
   - Test reading and writing of files with various content types
   - Ensure metadata is properly stored and retrieved

3. **Error Handling Tests**
   - Test behavior when files are missing or corrupted
   - Verify proper handling of permission issues
   - Test recovery mechanisms for interrupted operations

## Implementation Approach

### Test Environment

- Create a dedicated test environment with a controlled file system
- Use temporary directories that are cleaned up after tests
- Simulate various file system conditions (permissions, space limitations)

### Test Framework

- Use pytest as the primary test framework
- Create fixtures for common test scenarios
- Implement test helpers to simplify test setup and verification

### Test Data

- Define a set of standard test projects and structures
- Create test data generators for complex scenarios
- Use realistic content examples to test formatting and parsing

## Success Criteria

Integration tests will be considered complete when:

1. All identified workflows are covered by tests
2. File system interactions are thoroughly tested
3. Tests are stable and do not produce false positives/negatives
4. Test coverage meets or exceeds 90% for integration code paths
5. Tests run successfully in the CI/CD pipeline

## Deliverables

1. A comprehensive suite of integration tests in the `tests/integration/` directory
2. Test fixtures and helpers to support the tests
3. Documentation on how to run and extend the integration tests
4. Integration of these tests into the CI/CD pipeline
