# ProjectRepository Interface Specification

## Overview

The `ProjectRepository` interface defines the contract for storing and retrieving `Project` objects in the prosemark system. This interface follows the hexagonal architecture pattern, acting as a port that allows the domain to interact with various storage mechanisms through adapters.

## Interface Definition

The `ProjectRepository` interface should define the following methods:

### save_project

```python
def save_project(self, project: Project) -> None:
    """Saves a project to the repository.
    
    Args:
        project: The Project object to save.
        
    Raises:
        RepositoryError: If the project cannot be saved.
    """
```

### load_project

```python
def load_project(self, project_id: str) -> Project:
    """Loads a project from the repository.
    
    Args:
        project_id: The unique identifier of the project to load.
        
    Returns:
        The loaded Project object.
        
    Raises:
        ProjectNotFoundError: If no project with the given ID exists.
        RepositoryError: If the project cannot be loaded.
    """
```

### list_projects

```python
def list_projects(self) -> list[dict[str, str]]:
    """Lists all projects in the repository.
    
    Returns:
        A list of dictionaries containing project metadata.
        Each dictionary should contain at least 'id' and 'name' keys.
        
    Raises:
        RepositoryError: If the projects cannot be listed.
    """
```

### create_project

```python
def create_project(self, name: str, description: str = "") -> Project:
    """Creates a new project in the repository.
    
    Args:
        name: The name of the new project.
        description: An optional description of the project.
        
    Returns:
        The newly created Project object.
        
    Raises:
        ProjectExistsError: If a project with the same name already exists.
        RepositoryError: If the project cannot be created.
    """
```

### delete_project

```python
def delete_project(self, project_id: str) -> None:
    """Deletes a project from the repository.
    
    Args:
        project_id: The unique identifier of the project to delete.
        
    Raises:
        ProjectNotFoundError: If no project with the given ID exists.
        RepositoryError: If the project cannot be deleted.
    """
```

## Custom Exceptions

The interface should define the following custom exceptions:

```python
class RepositoryError(Exception):
    """Base exception for repository errors."""
    pass

class ProjectNotFoundError(RepositoryError):
    """Exception raised when a project is not found."""
    pass

class ProjectExistsError(RepositoryError):
    """Exception raised when attempting to create a project that already exists."""
    pass
```

## Implementation Requirements

Implementations of this interface should:

1. Handle all storage and retrieval operations for Project objects
2. Manage project metadata (id, name, description)
3. Ensure proper error handling with appropriate exceptions
4. Maintain data integrity during save/load operations
5. Follow the hexagonal architecture pattern as an adapter to a specific storage mechanism
```
